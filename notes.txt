As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.


TO DO:

1. Do validations on the limits for inputs such as (requres stuff, limit rating to 0.0 -> 5.0)
2. Collect rating from each NEW review created and add together to make average for OVERALL_RATING in desintation table.a
3. REVIEWS...pretty much all of that.
  - LEARN how to GET and POST via nested url
4. authentication for users (limit what they can and can't do..also figure out how you sign in?)
5. scopes for number of review, overall Ratings
6. RANDOM destination thing
7. Search functions for country or city
